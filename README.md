# Infrastrucutre_As_Code_POCs

A quick Introduction to Terraform: 
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or JSON. Terraform can manage popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. With Terraform, infrastructure can be planned before it is created, and changes can be previewed before they are applied, allowing for safe and predictable infrastructure management.
This repository contains sample Terraform codes to test a proof of concept for infrastructure as code using Terraform. The codes demonstrate the use of Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure on various cloud providers. The codes are meant to be a starting point for users who are new to Terraform and want to learn how to use it. The repository includes instructions on how to use the codes, as well as information on how to test and troubleshoot the infrastructure provisioned using Terraform.

Please note that, before using the codes in this repository, you will need to have a working installation of Terraform on your local machine and have appropriate credentials for the cloud provider you wish to use.

Make sure to review the sample codes and understand what it does before using it in production. Also, be aware of the cost of the resources you are provisioning in your cloud provider account.

Hope you will find this repository helpful.

Please reach out to the me with any questions or issues.
